scientists and data managers who create and share geospatial data.</p>
<h2>Steps to Run it Locally</h2><ol>
<li>Get NKN's <code>mdedit</code> code
``````````````````````````</li>
</ol>
<p>Clone the repository using git</p>
<p>.. code-block:: bash</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source"><code>git clone https://github.com/northwest-knowledge-network/mdedit.git</code></pre><p>Or you might try using the nice <code>OS X GUI client provided by GitHub &lt;https://mac.github.com/&gt;</code>_.</p>
<p>2.1 Install dependency MongoDB</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source"><code>
Then you need to install and start MongoDB, the database we use for a canonical representation of editor-created metadata.
The easiest way is to use `homebrew, the missing package manager for OS X &lt;http://brew.sh/>`_, which can be installed by entering
this at the command line
.. code-block:: bash
    ruby -e &quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)&quot;
Then use homebrew to install MongoDB
.. code-block:: bash
    brew install mongo
When this finishes, it gives us two instructions to follow to start using MongoDB,
.. code-block::
    To have launchd start mongodb at login:
        ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/mongodb/\*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
    Then to load mongodb now:
        launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.mongodb.plist
Follow these instructions, then type `mongo` at the command line.
If you see a new prompt ending with ``>``
then MongoDB is installed and ready.
2.2 Set up a Python virtual environment and install Python dependencies
`````````````````````````````````````````</code></pre><p>Make sure you have pip installed, a command-line package management tool for Python.  If you have Python 2.7.9 or higher,
you should already have pip. To check if you have pip installed,</p>
<p>.. code-block:: bash</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source"><code>which pip</code></pre><p>If you see a path to pip, something like <code>/usr/local/bin/pip</code>, then you do have pip installed. If you don't,
run</p>
<p>.. code-block:: bash</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source"><code>sudo easy_install pip</code></pre><p>Now install virtualenv and set up your environment with all the Python packages used by <code>mdedit</code></p>
<p>.. code-block:: bash</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source"><code>pip install virtualenv
virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python2.7 venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt</code></pre><p>2.3 Use Bower to install Javascript dependencies</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source"><code>
First, install Node.js and the node package manager, ``npm``. If running on
Linux, use your package manager to install node. The rest of this will be for
OS X. To install npm and Node on OS X, use homebrew
.. code-block:: bash
    brew install node
Then install Bower, another sort of package manager, globally like so using
your newly-installed node package manager.
.. code-block:: bash
    npm install -g bower
Now bower should be installed. From the root mdedit directory, run
.. code-block:: bash
    bower install
``bower`` will check ``bower.json`` for where to install packages including
Angular.js, Twitter Bootstrap, and JQuery.
3. Run the development web servers
``````````````````````````````````
Finally, we will start the two web servers, front and back end, needed for our
mdedit package. To do this, make sure your Python virtual environment has been
started and use ``startup.py`` like so
.. code-block:: bash
    ./startup.py run
If all is well, you can navigate to http://localhost:8000 in your browser to try out the
metadata editor:
.. image:: editor_screenshot.png
There is no explicit connection between the front end and the
back end server. To see the back end emit metadata, try these routes:
- http://localhost:4000/api/metadata: list of all Mongo records
- ``http://localhost:4000/api/metadata/{_oid}/xml``: Emit a generic XML record to be
  used by developers as a base for running XSLTs. Get ``_oid`` by inspecting
  a record from http://localhost:4000/api/metadata
You can view an XML record for some metadata easily by clicking the ``XML`` link
above the currently ugly list items. Or, to do it manually, find the ``_oid`` of
interest by inspecting the list of JSON metadata at
http://localhost:4000/api/metadata, find a metadata record of interest, copy the
``_oid`` and insert it into the URL like so, and put the URL in your browser:
``http://localhost:4000/api/metadata/{_oid}/xml``.  The braces and any other
quotes should be dropped.
4. Running the tests
````````````````````
There are three different tests to run: End-to-end tests using
`Protractor &lt;https://angular.github.io/protractor/#/>`_, server-side tests
using Python `nose &lt;http://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html>`_ and
the standard library's ``unittest`` module, and finally Angular &quot;specifications&quot;
using `Jasmine testing suite &lt;http://jasmine.github.io/1.3/introduction.html>`_
and the `Karma test runner &lt;http://karma-runner.github.io/0.13/index.html>`_.
Currently we use Jasmine 1.3, but we will be upgrading soon.
All three can be run, plus the option to run all at once, using
our ``startup.py``.
End-to-end:
.. code-block:: bash
    ./startup.py e2e
This particular test will produce a lot of output, but you'll know
if it passes if at the bottom of all the output you see
something like
.. code-block::
    10 specs, 0 failures
    Finished in 32.821 seconds
    Shutting down selenium standalone server.
    [launcher] 0 instance(s) of WebDriver still running
    [launcher] chrome #1 passed
There may be a different number of specs and a different time to
finish. The key is ``0 failures``.
Angular Specifications:
.. code-block:: bash
    ./startup.py ngSpec
Python tests:
.. code-block:: bash
    ./startup.py pyTest
All three at once, keeping the Karma server running:
.. code-block:: bash
    ./startup.py testAll
5. Try filling out and publishing a record
``````````````````````````````````````````
Publishing to the NKN portal is currently enabled. In development, new
&quot;published&quot; records will be saved to a local directory &quot;mdedit_preprod&quot;. This
can be changed by setting an environment variable `PREPROD_DIRECTORY`. See
`config.py` to see how this works.
More info
---------
The back end is written in `Flask &lt;http://flask.pocoo.org/>`_. The front end is Bootstrap
and Angular.
These two are totally separate, which is why they are hosted on two separate
servers. At NKN, we need this because we want to deploy our front end app to
many of our clients' content management systems with a single metadata server
handling requests from all of them.
Steps to Run it Remotely
-----------------------
1. Get NKN's `mdedit` code
``````````````````````````
Clone the repository using git. In this case, we are cloning the repository
twice: once for the front end, once for the back end.  In the future, the
front end and back end will be cloned to different servers, but this
process simulates that arrangement.
.. code-block:: bash
    sudo su
    cd /var/www/html
    rm -rf mdedit
    mkdir mdedit
    cd mdedit
    git clone https://github.com/northwest-knowledge-network/mdedit.git backend
    git clone https://github.com/northwest-knowledge-network/mdedit.git frontend
2. Use Bower to install Javascript dependencies
```````````````````````````````````````````````
Bower doesn't like to install as root, but root owns the frontend directory.
Chown the frontend to another user, become that user, install bower
components, return to the root user, and chown it all back to root.
.. code-block:: bash
    chown -R flathers frontend
    su -l flathers
    cd frontend
    bower install
    exit
    chown -R root frontend
3. Configure the database connection
````````````````````````````````````
.. code-block:: bash
    cd backend/app/api
    chown root:apache gptInsert.conf
    chmod o-r gptInsert.conf
    vi gptInsert.conf [change the database connection info]
    service httpd restart
4. Configure Drupal to display the mdedit blocks</code></pre><p>The .txt files in /frontend/drupal contain block configuration and content
for a drupal node called 'metadata' that will display the metadata editor.</p>          </article>        </section>        <!-- class files -->      </div>      <footer style="clear:both">        Documentation generated by        <a href="https://github.com/jsdoc3/jsdoc">JSDoc 3.3.2</a>        using        <a href="https://github.com/allenhwkim/angular-jsdoc">Angular-JSDoc template</a>      </footer>    </div>    <script src="js/prettify.js"></script>    <script src="js/angular.min.js"></script>    <script src="js/site.js"></script>    <!--%= prettyJson %-->    <script>      prettyPrint();      var lineNo = window.location.hash.match(/#line([0-9]+)$/);      lineNo && document.querySelector("ol li:nth-child("+(lineNo[1])+")").scrollIntoView();    </script>  </body></html>
