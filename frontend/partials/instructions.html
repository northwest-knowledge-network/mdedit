<h5> Get started using NKN's Metadata Editor: </h5>
<div style="margin-left: 2em; font-size: small">
  You can use NKN's Editor to create a valid ISO 19115 metadata record for your dataset or dataset series or a Dublin Core metadata record for your non-data research product (tool, visualization product, model, script, etc.). Be sure to Save your Draft as you work, found under the Record option. Once you have completed all required fields in the form (highlighted in red), you will have the option to submit your record to the NKN Portal for publication, use the <strong><i>Publish Record to NKN Portal</strong></i>. Once submitted, we will review and publish your record. If you make changes to a record you have already submited, you will need to resubmit. To view your metadata record as valid ISO 19115 metadata, use the <strong><i>ISO</strong></i> options under Actions. You can start a new record at any time by using the <strong><i>Create New</strong></i> choice under Record Options.
