Welcome to mdedit's documentation!
==================================

``mdedit`` is the Northwest Knowledge Network's utility for creating,
updating, and exporting metadata and managing data. It empowers users to 
share their data through the NKN data portal along with metadata properly
formatted to conform to relevant metadata standards.

This guide is for mdedit developers. It covers the structure and design of the
mdedit stack, from the MongoDB database to the Flask HTTP services to
the Angular front end.  The next page, :doc:`quickstart` shows how to 
install mdedit, how to start the front and back end servers, and how to 
run the tests.

After the quickstart, see details about the Flask back end at
:doc:`flask-backend` and the Angular front-end in :doc:`angular-frontend`.
